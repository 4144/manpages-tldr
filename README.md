manpages-tldr
=============

This project aims to make fast-updated, practical and precise manpages with
*examples* for everyday usage. Its idea based on similar projects, like
[bropages](http://bropages.org/) and [tldr](https://github.com/rprieto/tldr),
but written as part of real manpages (mostly converted from Markdown with
pandoc).
